# About
This project gives a nice visualization of how different sorting algorithms work. This is helpful to anyone trying to understand these algorithms or even to someone who has already grasped them. This was implemented fully using numpy and matplotlib in python. It's also fully interactive though matplotlib is being push to its limits.
