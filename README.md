# About
This is a tool to visualize the operations of the most popular search and sorting algorithms. This is helpful to anyone trying to understand these algorithms or even to someone who has already grasped them. This was implemented fully using NumPy and Matplotlib in Python. It's also fully interactive though matplotlib is being pushed to its limits and can be slow at times.
