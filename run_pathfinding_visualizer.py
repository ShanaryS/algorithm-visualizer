# --- Mutltithreading/Multiprocessing ---
# Maybe just put pygame and logic on two distinct processes at leave it at that
#   - Else probably would need to mantually set processes then manually assign it to everything
#   - Need to already have processes started else there won't be any performance increase
# psutil.cpu_count(logical=True/False), add to requirements.txt
# May need multiprocessing.freeze_support()
# 2ms to 54us for thread startup, linear scaling for func calls
# 1.35s to 600us for process startup, non linear scaling for increased func calls
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66018977/using-multiprocessing-with-pygame
# Update performance section of github with Multiprocessing/Multithreading
# All performance intensive code
#   - Cannot update two neighbouring squares if becoming a wall is possible
#   - Keep pygame on its own processor at all times?
#       - Whenever calling funcs that update pygame: draw, draw_vis_text, reset_graph, reset_algo
#       - E.g algo button reset and draw calls are 80ms vs 700ms for entire algo after
#       - No point if draw call is right before run_pathfinding or other non time critical event
#   - run_pathfinding_visualizer.py
#   - node.py (Not invidiually)
#       - _discard_node
#       - clear_all_node_lists
#       - update_nieghbours
#       - _update_surrounding_neighbour_pool
#   - graph.py
#       - set_graph
#       - set_squares_to_roads*
#       - reset_graph
#       - reset_algo
#   - algorithms.py
#       - dijkstra*
#       - a_star*
#       - bi_dijkstra*
#       - best_path*
#       - draw_recursive_maze*
# Write tests for both threading and multiprocessing

# --- Known Bugs ---
# Bi dijk redraws open nodes
# Bi dijk only draws best_path when edges of swarms are touching, mid node

# --- Features to add ---
# Sticky mud for patches where algo goes slowly
# Take in consideration speed limit of roads
#   Use length of open_set to assign queue_pos
# Add prim maze
# Write tests

# --- C++ Performance Rewrite ---
# Rewrite node.py, algorithms.py into C++
# Rewrite all code that iterates through gph.graph, slow when max graph size (Using maps)
#   Adding _update_surrounding_neighbour_pool() to other set_ methods 0.1x performance in python
#   Changing to large graph takes 40ms
# Create new branch 'archive/python_only'
